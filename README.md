# Front-End-SignUp-Validation

The given source code consists on HTML,CSS and JS with form validation as per user when he/she clicks on the submit button. Wep-page is made ineteractive by applying various styles using css. The icons present in the site have been taken using fab icon links and then the classes have been used instead of storing them locally. For using fonts, I've used Google Fonts with links placed in the header section.
The user won't be able to apply on submit until all the neccessary conditions placed in javascript are fulfilled. It will display an alert messagae using window.alert function and change the border to red for specified group
On success the border will change to green color showing no issues encountered.
